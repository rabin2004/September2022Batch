		// 1. Single Inheritance - parent->child relation
		// 2. Multi-layer Inheritance - grandParent->parent->child->grandChild relation
		// 3. Hierarichal Inheritance - child_1 <- parent -> child_2
		// 4. Multiple Inheritance -> parent_2 -> child <- parent_1 | in case of classes, is not allowed | in case of interface, it is allowed

	// create relation -> "extends" keywords -> used in child/sub class to inherit super/parent class
