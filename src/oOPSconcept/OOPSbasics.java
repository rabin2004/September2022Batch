	// OOPS: Object Oriented Programming Concept
		
	// 1. Inheritance: create parent-child relation | child can inherit parent's property but parent can't from child
	// 2. Method Overriding: -> Method overloading Vs Method overriding -> method with same signature in different classes related by inheritance, where child class method will override parent method
	// 3. Polymorphisim: object can have different state
	// 4. Encapsulation: medicine inside a capsule - data hiding
	// 5. Abstraction: -> hiding functionalities and only showing that can be accessed/used
	// 6. Interface: -> different java file other than class -> all methods defined will be default abstract
	
	
	// Assignment:	1. App with Online Registration account/Login/Apply debit or credit - every feature in different class
				//	2. create main class for execution
				//	3. Inheritance: RegClass->LoginClass->accountApp->mainClass
				//	5. DOB/SSN/password -> Encapsulation
				//	6. Method overriding
				//	7. Polymorphism
